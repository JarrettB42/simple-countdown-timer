# simple-countdown-timer
A lua script for OBS that provides a visibility controlled text timer countdown.

# notes

The timer is reset to the specified duration everytime it becomes visible (source toggle or scene change).

You can also bind a hotkey to reset it on command. Useful when you're setting up and need 5 more minutes :)
